to use scrape_google_api.py: `pip install google-api-python-client`

To use, first create a google cloud account, I do think it needs to be linked to a card. Then create a project and add a api key in the credentials section. After that, go to the programmable search engine control panel and create a programmable search engine and get the search engine id. After that, replace the api_key and search_engine_id strings with the corresponding values. Run the script and it should print out the google results.
